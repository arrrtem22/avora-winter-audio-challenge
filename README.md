# Avora Winter Audio Challenge 2026

Create your own novel audio visualization using real-time microphone input.

[Live Demo](https://avora-task.vercel.app)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and allow microphone access when prompted.

## The Challenge

Edit `src/visualizers/Visualizer.tsx` to create your own visualization. You have been given a default starter template that shows audio visualized in the frequency and time domains.

## Audio Pipeline

The `useAudio` hook captures microphone input.

From the hook, you will receive:
- **frequencyData** — 1024 FFT frequency bins from low to high.
- **timeDomainData** — 2048 raw waveform samples. A value of 128 is silence, and 0 and 255 are the lowest and highest values respectively.

You SHOULD NOT update useAudio, and should instead focus on using its return values for your visualization.

## Submissions

Fork this repo and get nerdy with a visualization that you find super cool.

When you're ready, deploy your solution and send the URL + link to your submission's github repo to careers@getavora.ai

We evaluate solutions on craft and novelty. You may use any AI tools that you like in this process.

Have fun!
